		I am Noelle Alyanna M. Lim but my family also call me "Nian". <sup>1</sup>
		I was born on November 24, 1999, Wednesday at Metropolitan Hospital in Manila. <sup>2</sup>
		The reason why I was named Noelle is because, my papa wanted to have a little junior. <sup>3</sup>
		So technically I am a the girl version of him, and I won't even complain because we have the same characteristics.<sup>4</sup>			
		I am the second child of us four siblings and me my ate are the closest since we're just one year apart.<sup>5</sup>
		Ever since I was young, we lived in Marikina City and had been staying here for more than 20 years. <sup>6</sup>
		Fun fact about this house, my lolo built this for us and we are one of the first families to live in this 
		subdivision. <sup>7</sup> 
		I remember these photos, my mom use to say that she loves dressing us up after having two girls in an instant. <sup>8</sup>
		Life was already tough for us from the time we we're born. <sup>9</sup>
		<img src="ChildMe.jpg" alt="Photo of Me & my Two siblings" title="Photo of Me & my Two siblings" class="border" width="250" height="200" style="border:20px; margin:20px" align="right">
		Me and my ate are always sick, experiencing high fever, combulsions and even UTI. <sup>10</sup>
		This has led us to emergency in hospitals all the time and one of the reasons why we had financial problems. <sup>11</sup>
		Though we have those family issues, we remain happy and contented with what we have. <sup>12</sup> 
		During the first five years, when two of us are the only "bulinggit" in the family, 
		we were overwhelmed by parental guidance since most of the people here are adults. <sup>13</sup>
		Different people took care of us, from the close family, extended family and far relatives they were all present. <sup>14</sup>
		They were so strict that they won't let us play outside with other kids. <sup>15</sup>
		<img src="fam.jpg" alt="Our Family Picture" title="Our Family Picture" class="border" width="250" height="300" style="border:20px; margin:20px" align="left">
		Also, I remember belts, hangers, wood are my worst enemy and even the walls because we had to face them when 
		we have done something wrong. <sup>16</sup>
		We have experienced so much discipline and I won't ever forget them. <sup>17</sup>
		Being the first batch of children in the Lim Family, we were spoiled not just in the material side but with love. <sup>18</sup>
		Then when my brother existed, my grandparents (angkong and amah) were so happy because having a boy means so much 
		for Chinese families. <sup>19</sup>
		They made sure that the boys are the future of the family and will take care of the name that will surely live their 
		lives for our ancestors. <sup>20</sup>
		I would say, my childhood years were so memorable and fun even though I cried a lot. <sup>21</sup>
		I will always treasure them. <sup>22</sup>

		<img src="Six.jpg" alt="Highschool Friends" title="Highschool Friends" width="300" height="170" style="border:20px; margin:20px" align="left">
		During my teenage years I believed it was roller coaster ride. <sup>1</sup>
		This was the time when I started high school, a fresh start in a new school. <sup>2</sup>
		By this time it was already my fourth school after transfering in between my elementary days. <sup>3</sup>
		I was really afraid to socialize and interact with people I met for the first time. <sup>4</sup>
		But, I remained strong and believed that I need to go out of my comfort zone to have a great year. <sup>5</sup>
		Throughout my first year, I met friends who were kind and approachable but I was sure that not all of them will last.<sup>6</sup> 
		But as we finished another year, by then I was sure of the few people, 
		five to be exact who remained with me in my ups and downs.<sup>7</sup> 
		<img src="Bridget.jpg" alt="SBS(SHS)Classmates" title="SBS(SHS)Classmates" width="300" height="200" style="border:20px; margin:20px" align="right">
		As you can see from the photo on the left, these were my friends from high school and we are still together. <sup>8</sup>
		I discovered so much about myself amongst those years. <sup>9</sup>
		I pushed myself to the limit and joined dance competitions, became a host for school events and part of the class topnotchers.<sup>10</sup>
		That's why I appreciate my teachers so much because they made sure that I'd be able to maximize my abilities. <sup>11</sup>
		As I graduated highschool, we were half-hearted upon knowing that we are part of the first batch for 
		<abbr title="Senior Highschool">SHS</abbr>.<sup>12</sup>
		But looking on the bright side, it was a good experience and I enjoyed the environment of my new school at that time. <sup>13</sup>
		<img src="sbs.jpg" alt="SBS(SHS)Classmates" title="SBS(SHS)Classmates" width="300" height="200" style="border:20px; margin:20px" align="left">
		The school I went to during my <abbr title="Senior Highschool">SHS</abbr> days is <abbr title="St. Bridget School">SBS</abbr> 
		and it is an exclusive Catholic school for girls.<sup>14</sup>
		Though I only stayed for two years, it was one of the best decision I've ever made because I had the best people with me.<sup>15</sup>
		I made relationships that I'm sure of will last for a life time. <sup>16</sup>
		I remembered in our <abbr title="Humanities and Social Sciences">SHS</abbr> class, we were only 28 in the class and 
		we are very close to one another. <sup>17</sup>
		We've encountered girl fights, to open forums, to class projects that eventually made us unite together as a class. <sup>18</sup>
		As we were on our last days in <abbr title="St. Bridget School">SBS</abbr> and practicing our graduation, 
		we were very emotional leaving the school and teachers that has been like a family to us. <sup>19</sup>
		I was grateful for this opportunity because I became part of With High Honors, which made my parents proud and happy. <sup>20</sup>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Then came my college years, this was the time when I had to make major and adult decisions. <sup>1</sup>
		Decisions that will secure my future with the course I will take and join organizations that I may 
		find support in all aspects of my life.<sup>2</sup>
		I remember during the enrollment, due to my family having financial problems, I worked part-time. <sup>3</sup> 
		After school I go to work and when I get home I get to do my homeworks. <sup>4</sup>
		And God really works in mysterious ways, he gave me a sponsor that helped me pay for the last two months left of my tuition.<sup>5</sup>
		Another year came and application for Student Assistants was open, then I thought it is a great idea for me to try because 
		it will also help my family. <sup>6</sup>
		Right then and there after all the waiting and passing, I was accepted and I was very happy for the opportunity being able to 
		serve my college. <sup>7</sup>
		As for the first day of my college life, though I just met them for the first time, we were already close to one another.<sup>8</sup>
		<img src="College.jpg" alt="Me with my College Friends" title="Me with my College Friends" width="280" height="200" style="border:20px; margin:20px" align="right">
		I even remember, some of our classmates find it weird that we were already very noisy and thought we all came from one school.<sup>9</sup>
		And I am tremendously happy that I met them because they are now like my siblings, who I can trust and rely on.<sup>10</sup>
		To be honest, I even met someone who gave me inspiration to study well and to whom I look forward to an exciting future with.<sup>11</sup>
		More than just the fun and excitement, I also experienced disappointements and lack of motivation in studying.<sup>12</sup>
		I began to compare my abilities to classmates and tried to keep up with them.<sup>13</sup>
		This made me hopeless at the time because I had no background in coding and I don't think I'll ever learn.<sup>14</sup>
		<img src="Youth.jpg" alt="Me with Youth Core Leaders" title="Me with Youth Core Leaders" width="310" height="200" style="border:20px; margin:20px" align="left">
		But with the help of my classmates and the lectures of my professors, I began to enjoy to learn and practice my coding skills.<sup>15</sup>
		And I know for myself that I'm still in the process of learning and getting the hang of it. <sup>16</sup>
		During the college years, my college life wasn't just the highlight of it but also me being part of our church youth core leaders.<sup>17</sup>
		They are very close to my heart because they motivate me and give me the eagerness to know God in a deeper level.<sup>18</sup>
		It is really my desire let other people know and experience the same happiness I have, and that is to be in His presence and 
		being part of a family like this. <sup>19</sup>
		It's just very comforting to know that especially in this college life, when there are times that I feel discouraged 
		or unmotivated I know where to cling to and get my strength from.<sup>20</sup>
